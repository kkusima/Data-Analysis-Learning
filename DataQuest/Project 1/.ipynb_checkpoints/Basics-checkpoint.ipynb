    "## 2. Objective:\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> $\\hspace{5 mm}$ For this project, I pretend I am working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile applications (apps). They make apps available both on Google Play and the App Store. </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> $\\hspace{5 mm}$ The company only build apps that are free to download and install, and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that different companies can pay to have their ads appear in various parts of the application. This means that revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. <b> My goal for this project is to analyze application data and assist the company developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. </b> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying and analysing the most attractive application types, the company hopes to follow the strategy outlined in the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use results from the analysis to generate a minimal Android version of the \"perfect\" app and add it to the Google Play Store. \n",
    "- Asses and monitor the application's user response and further develop the app if good ratings are recieved.\n",
    "- After six month, if substantial profit is seen, build an iOS version of the app and add it to the Apple App Store.\n"

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> $\\hspace{5 mm}$ The project successfuly analysed mobile phone application datasets from both Google Play Store and Apple App Stores. This was to deduce an application genre that would prove profitable in both Google Play Store and Apple App Store, where primary mode of profit is through in-app purchases. Datasets were cleaned to include only free, English-based applications. The likelihood of the applications to be installed (Application Popularity) was assesed using average number of ratings per genre in the Google Play Store dataset and the average number of installs per genre in the Apple App Store dataset. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> $\\hspace{5 mm}$ The resulting application genre chosen was that of a book/reference application with video content capabilities and with the intention of fostering a social environment. The application could be used as a means to learn new skills (through books and video tutorials) or simply to have exciting discussions 'book clubs' through virtual means such as video conferencing. </p>"
